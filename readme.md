#PWA Books
This repository contains an example application to show how a progressive web app can work with Angular 2.

## Installation
###Api
To setup the Server Api you have to execute `npm install` in the directory _api_.

###Client
To setup the Client Application you have to execute `npm install` in the directory _client_.


## How to run the application
Before you start the appliction you have to start the Api. Therefore you only have to execute `npm start` in the directory `api`. Node will start an Api server with the address _http://localhost:8090_. 

To start the application run `npm start` in the directory `client`. The sample application will now be available on _http://localhost:8888_.
